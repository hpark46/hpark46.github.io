									<p>I started my first school life alone in the US at a Catholic Highschool, Georgetown Preparatory School, for four years. During my time I have adapted and came upon to enjoy the conservative, academic centered atmosphere, learning what to pursue in my life along with the balance of education and other activities.</p>
									<p>Entering University of Rochester, I studied Computer Science with human-computer interaction as area of concentration. As one of required course I took Artificial Intelligence and worked on various assignment and projects. Two of the projects related to natural language inference first drew my interest in the field of NLU and as I excelled in the course, I have decided to further educate myself in machine learning after graduation.</p>
									<p>Since graduation, I researched various models and datasets used in NLP taking by taking online courses and doing independent researches. One of the most helpful course was a NLP Boot-Camp hosted by 'Wanted', a job posting website. In a short period of time I was taught about subtask of NLU, BERT based models, preprocessing, training tokenizer with desired vocabs, hyperparameter search, and was given an opportunity to practice these knowledge as a team by working on projects.</p>
									<p>Currently, I am further studying the structures of pre-trained models, SOTA papers and NLU sub-tasks.</p>
